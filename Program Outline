--Give the users the rules to the game and have them accept to progress--  
Give the users a chance to find out what the genres entails. (Ex. If they type video games tell the user their guess should be video game titles/franchies.) 
Have user choose a specific genre (Up to 4)
Each time the user guesses a letter/word wrong the body parts and limbs appear until the full stick figure appears. (7 tries)
User can guess a letter and have that letter disappear from the word bank to let them know they used that letter.
Or can guess the full word, if they guess the full word none of the letters from the word bank should disappear. (only when they guess a single letter)



Program should look something like this
